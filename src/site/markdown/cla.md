# Sentry Software Contributor License Agreement

Thank you for your interest in contributing to MetricsHub and Sentry Software open-source repositories. To clarify the intellectual property license granted with your contributions, MetricsHub requires a Contributor License Agreement ("CLA") that confirms you have the right to, and do, grant us the necessary rights to use your contributions. This license is for your protection as well as the protection of MetricsHub and its users; it does not change your rights to use your own contributions for any other purpose.

You hereby agree to the following terms:

**Grant of Rights**: You grant to Sentry Software a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, irrevocable license to use, reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute your contributions and such derivative works in any software project or product, including but not limited to the MetricsHub Community edition and the MetricsHub Enterprise edition.

**Re-licensing**: You agree that MetricsHub may relicense your contributions under any license terms, including without limitation, any open source or commercial license.

**Originality and Ownership**: You represent that you are legally entitled to grant the above license. If your employer(s) has rights to intellectual property that you create, you represent that you have received permission to make contributions on behalf of that employer, or that your employer has waived such rights for your contributions to MetricsHub and other Sentry Software open-source projects. You represent that your contributions are your original creations and/or that you have sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by this CLA.

**No Obligation to Use**: You understand that the decision to include your contributions in any project or product is entirely at the discretion of Sentry Software, and you waive any claims related to such decision.

**Representations and Warranties**: You represent and warrant that your contributions do not infringe or violate any intellectual property rights of any third party.

By formally accepting in one of our submissions, you accept and agree to the terms of this Contributor License Agreement for your present and future contributions to MetricsHub and Sentry Software open-source projects.
